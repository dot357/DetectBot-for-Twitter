Twitter is crowded.This helps you to find wich group you want.

Detect terrorist sympathizers and report for goverment.

This can prevent terror attacks.

Update 12.05.2017

I have decided to make 2 bots becouse of twitters rate limit.

bots are called typeA and typeB

TypeA bot does:

#typeA bot this bot's duty is discover posible threats and put them in text file or db for passing data to typeB bot that is just following and preparing report for individual.

#First of all we need a start point.This can be either your account that you got keys or a starting point such as "isis twitter account"

#with this way you can expand your network.I will make it dynamic so program takes a string for starting point.

TypeB bot does:


#Follow them 

#Further echantments will be added not decided the algorytm yet posible ai or machine learnign will stick with this becouse of i need to identify eighter person related the topic or not.if person related how is related and what is persons' role on that topic.This will be the hard part i think.
